Welcome to the Access Toolkit for Artworkers.

This is a practical resource for artworkers, such as curators, producers and arts administrators working independently or in galleries, museums and art organisations. This toolkit contains practical information on how to plan, produce, and exhibit accessible art projects; including information of access riders, financial planning, slow production, display and creating an accessible workplace. This information is intended to address the access barriers faced by d/Deaf, neurodivergent, chronically ill and disabled artists, audiences and artworkers, and those who experience ableism. The information in this toolkit has been gathered anonymously from a wide range of disabled artists, curators and producers and those working in art organisations dedicated to commissioning disabled artists. It has also been informed by the author’s own experience as a disabled curator, who has faced access barriers and ableism working in art. It is most relevant to working in the UK and Ireland but is applicable in a wide set of contexts. This is not an exhaustive resource but is intended to support artworkers to begin the process of addressing ableism in their practices and workplaces accessible for disabled artists, audiences, colleagues and themselves.

This toolkit follows in the example and shares knowledge with toolkits and resources created by Caroyln Lazard, Sins Invalid, Unlimited, Leah Clements, Alice Hattrick and Lizzy Rose. This toolkit follows a Disability Justice approach and Talila A Lewis’s definition of ableism. In Accessibility In the Arts: A Promise and a Practice, Carolyn Lazard states that Disability Justice was “\[d]eveloped by queer and trans activists of color in the Bay area, Disability Justice (DJ) is the second wave of the disability rights movement, transforming it from a single issue approach to an intersectional, multisystemic way of looking at the world. Within this framework, disability is defined as an economic, cultural, and/or social exclusion based on a physical, psychological, sensory, or cognitive difference. Disability Justice movements understand disability to be unevenly distributed, primarily affecting black and indigenous communities, queer and trans communities, and low income communities. Disability is structurally reinforced by ableism, a system rooted in the supremacy of non-disabled people and the disenfranchisement of disabled people through the denial of access” Talila A Lewis’s defines ableism as a: “\[a] system of assigning value to people's bodies and minds based on societally constructed ideas of normalcy, productivity, desirability, intelligence, excellence, and fitness. These constructed ideas are deeply rooted in eugenics, anti-Blackness, misogyny, colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism. This systemic oppression that leads to people and society determining people's value based on their culture, age, language, appearance, religion, birth or living place, "health/wellness", and/or their ability to satisfactorily re/produce, "excel" and "behave." You do not have to be disabled to experience ableism.”

It is the responsibility of artworkers to undo the ableism in art spaces and commit to access as an ongoing practice in an effort to eradicate access barriers for working, making and experiencing art for /Deaf, neurodivergent, chronically ill and disabled communities.

Access Toolkit for Artworkers is supported by the Arts Council England’s Developing Your Creative Practice award and the Creative Production Supports initiative field:arts.
