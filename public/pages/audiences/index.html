<p>This section will cover how to make artworks, exhibitions and programmes accessible for audiences. There are many ways to make an artwork or art project accessible and each project requires a different set of access tools informed by the medium, the access needs of the audience, and the wishes of the artist.</p>
<p>There are two differing perspectives on how to use access tools in artworks. There is the American Model that requires everything to be accessible to everyone all the time, which can be unrealistic, especially for small organisations with limited budgets and access clashes. This model is based on the <a href="https://www.ada.gov">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> and the specific legal requirements organisations and companies have in the USA. And there is the Creative Model that involves more of a conversation between access and creative intent of the artist, attempting to make artworks as accessible as possible without compromising artistic vision. What model you use is dependent on staff preference, who you’re trying to reach and the artist. This section details the access tools you can use when you make these decisions.</p>
<p>This section includes information included in Carolyn Lazards' foundational <a href="https://promiseandpractice.art/">Accessibility in the Arts: A Promise and a Practice</a>, which has been amended to be more relevant to the UK and Irish context.</p>
<h3 id="access-statement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#access-statement">§</a> Access Statement</h3>
<p>An access statement is a statement on a project webpage and/or printed matter that includes access information on an exhibition, event or space. This includes information on the venue such as whether it is step free, wheelchair accessible, has an accessible bathroom, a quiet room and information on how to travel to the event by public transport. It should provide information on artworks and events such as if there will be a sign language interpreter, audio description, captioning and breaks, or requests to wear a mask or not wear perfume.</p>
<p>It is vital to communicate what isn’t accessible so audiences can make informed decisions about attending. It is also important to provide an email that is checked regularly and/or a phone number where access enquiries can be made. The disability justice centred, POC and queer performance art project Sins Invalid have been instrumental in founding and championing the practice of access statements. You can find a useful list of access suggestions for public events on the <a href="http://www.sinsinvalid.org/news-1/2020/6/8/access-suggestions-for-public-events.">Sins Invalid’s Access Suggestions for Public Events</a>.</p>
<h3 id="accessible-wc" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accessible-wc">§</a> Accessible WC</h3>
<p>Accessible restrooms are essential for a wide range of disabled people including wheelchair users, alongside parents, older people and carers. There are a number of standards a restroom must meet to be accessible, with a full list of requirements on the <a href="https://www.iwa.ie/access-guidelines/great-outdoors-access-guidelines/7-access-to-the-built-environment/#:~:text=Public%20Toilet%2FWC%20Accessible%20Independent%20Use%20Provision&amp;text=In%20the%20male%20WC%20block,if%20the%20door%20opens%20inwards.">Irish Wheelchair Association</a> page on accessing the built environment.</p>
<p>Accessible WCs should also be gender neutral to prevent gender policing, and to be accessible to Trans, Non-Binary and Gender Non-Confirming Disabled People. When possible there should be another gender neutral restroom available so the accessible restroom is not the only gender neutral option available.</p>
<p>It is also vital to provide changing places for people with disabilities and their carers. A changing place is a wheelchair-accessible toilet that includes a hoist, height adjustable adult-sized changing bench, height adjustable basin and toilet, large enough for a disabled person and two carers.</p>
<h3 id="audio-description" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#audio-description">§</a> Audio Description</h3>
<p>Audio description is the narration of visual materials that facilitates access for the blind and those with low vision. Audio description can be used to reduce barriers to film, which can be used in a separate audio described file played in rotation with other versions or integrated into the original soundtrack.</p>
<p>For live performance you can have a pre-recorded audio description version available for blind and low vision audience members available via headphones or live audio description of the performance, also available via headphones.</p>
<p>For painting, sculpture, installation and other visual mediums, pre-recorded audio described versions can be available via headphones. Alternatively audio description services can be provided by trained staff through tours.</p>
<p>Audio description services can be provided by professionals, or by training staff with services sourced internally.</p>
<p>Audio Description services are symbolised using this symbol:</p>

<h3 id="childcare" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#childcare">§</a> Childcare</h3>
<p>The needs of parents and their children should be considered when planning programmes. This can include providing spaces for children to play or children and family friendly tours and activities, such as screenings where parents can bring their young children. Organisations should also look to provide suitable baby changing facilities, welcome breastfeeding, and where possible provide breastfeeding stations. It can also be helpful to flag if an event or programme is child friendly or contains adult content to support parents and caregiving to make an informed decision.</p>
<h3 id="closed-captioning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#closed-captioning">§</a> Closed Captioning</h3>
<p>Closed captioning facilitates access for d/Deaf and hard of hearing communities. It includes text-based transcription of dialogue and description of sounds, effects, and music. It can be used in live performance, film, online projects, public programmes and meetings. Closed captions are available for free on YouTube and available with a subscription on online meeting services such as Zoom. These are auto captions generated through AI software and are not always accurate. Closed captions are not subtitles and presume the viewers cannot hear. Subtitles do not address the access needs of d/Deaf or hard of hearing people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stagetext.org/">Stagetext</a> provides custom captioning for live and prerecorded plays, performances and films. <a href="https://www.mycleartext.com/">My Clear Text</a> and <a href="http://pcr.ie/#about">Premier Captioning</a> provide live captioning services for live events such as plays, performances, talks and conferences. These are the most accurate captioning services with about 98% accuracy, and their use is best practice.</p>
<p>For a limited service <a href="https://otter.ai/home">Otter.ai</a> live transcription is available for online and in person meetings and talks, but only captions the spoken word and not other sounds or music. This is also auto generated via AI software and is significantly less accurate than other services. The accuracy of captioning with companies such as Otter.ia drops to 70-75%, which should be considered when planning for the needs of captions users.</p>

<h3 id="communication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#communication">§</a> Communication</h3>
<p>Many people have varying communication styles, and people with psychological, developmental, learning and cognitive disabilities face significant barriers accessing spaces due to inaccessible language. With that in mind, it is vital that artworkers consider how to communicate in accessible ways and to accommodate varying communication styles. This can include speaking slowly and clearly, avoiding long words or the use of jargon, which is inaccessible for many. Some disabled people may also take longer to respond when spoken to, be unable to maintain eye contact or need to twitch.</p>
<p>When running an event, there should be a member of staff who makes an announcement about the event, detailing their name, the schedule, access information and designating themselves as someone to come to for access support. Having a well trained, friendly and supportive member of staff available for audiences to speak to goes a long way in supporting all audiences to feel comfortable in experiencing art and attending art venues and spaces.</p>
<h4 id="consent" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#consent">§</a> Consent</h4>
<p>A culture of consent should be fostered in art spaces and events. Staff should be trained to request consent when entering someone's personal space, touching someone or handling their assistive devices. Consent should also be sought when offering support, and never given unless requested or consent given to do so. If a performance includes physical interaction, that should be clearly stated in the announcement and event literature.</p>
<h3 id="content-warnings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#content-warnings">§</a> Content Warnings</h3>
<p>Content warnings reduce access barriers for people withpsychological disabilities, particularly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD can be triggered for a number of reasons depending of the individual's experience but common topics that should be mentioned in content warnings include: rape and sexual assault, suicide and self-harm, incest and child abuse, and gendered and racialized violence. If triggered, a survivor of trauma can experience panic attacks, psychotic episodes, and a wide host of emotional and physiological symptoms.</p>
<p>Content warnings can be verbally announced at the beginning of an event or shared via an access statement or at the beginning of a screening. Organisations and artworkers cannot control how audiences react in their spaces but content warnings are a useful tool that empowers audiences to make an informed decision.</p>
<h3 id="dementia-friendly-events" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dementia-friendly-events">§</a> Dementia Friendly Events</h3>
<p>Dementia friendly tours are facilitated events with a trained member of staff for people with Alzheimers and Dementia and their friends, family and carers. Dementia friendly events reduce barriers to participating in arts and culture for a group at greater risk of exclusion and isolation, and provide health benefits through connecting with art.</p>
<p>You can find more information on dementia friendly event in Ireland on the <a href="https://ageandopportunity.ie/engage/azure-dementia-friendly-tours/#phone">Azure</a> page of Age and Opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="exhibition-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exhibition-design">§</a> Exhibition Design</h3>
<p>When designing an exhibition, access for wheelchair users or little people can be facilitated by hanging artworks at a lower height. The standard hanging height for 2D artworks is 150cm, but by lowering that to 100cm, access barriers to experiencing the artwork are reduced. If there is printed matter or brochures available, they should also be visible and available to take at a height that is accessible. This should also be the case for vinyl displays, especially where information is provided about the exhibition. When designing an exhibition, it is also important to consider how a wheelchair user or those using mobility aids navigate the space. When installing sculptural, installation or 3D artworks, it is vital that there is at least 1.5m between artworks.</p>
<p>A QR code can also be available at entrances, linking to the exhibition access statement and other access tools such as transcriptions.</p>
<h3 id="lighting-and-flashing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lighting-and-flashing">§</a> Lighting and Flashing</h3>
<p>Harsh lighting can trigger photosensitive epilepsy and chronic migraines. Venues should consider dimming, and using LED lights instead of fluorescent lighting, which are more triggering. Audiences should have the choice of making a flexible lighting and volume request before attending.</p>
<p>If an artwork, film or performance includes flashing or stroboscopic lights, audiences should be informed in advance and this information clearly stated in the access statement. Flash photography should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and if used a clear warning should be given to audience members.</p>
<h3 id="masks-and-covid-safer-events" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#masks-and-covid-safer-events">§</a> Masks and COVID Safer Events</h3>
<p>With COVID policies in most public spaces having been lifted, older, chronically ill and those with suppressed immune systems face huge risks in attending public events. Events can be made safer with HEPA filters, requesting mask wearing, maintaining social distance, and to take a COVID test before attending. It should also be advised that anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms should not attend, and when in doubt, not to attend. Please note that oral d/Deaf people often use lipreading to understand speakers, so speakers should remove masks when speaking or wear clear masks.</p>
<p>Alternatively, regular masked events should be programmed, to provide safe and accessible opportunities to experience a programme.</p>
<h3 id="online-events-and-live-streaming" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#online-events-and-live-streaming">§</a> Online Events and Live Streaming</h3>
<p>Many people cannot attend in person events for multiple reasons such as disability, access barriers, geography, cost or personal responsibilities. All public events should be available online or be live streamed, expanding the reach of the event and reducing barriers to participation. This can be done via online meeting services such as <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>’s Webinar feature or live streaming services. Online meeting software often includes captioning services which facilitate access ford/Deaf and hard of hearing?</p>
<h3 id="navilens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#navilens">§</a> Navilens</h3>
<p><a href="https://museos.navilens.com/index-en.html">Navilens</a> is a smartphone enabled technology that via an app scans colourful codes and guides blind and low vision people to navigate public spaces. Navilens can be used in galleries as digital signage to guide and share information with vocal instructions for blind and low vision attendees.</p>
<p>Learn more about Navilens on Art and Disability Ireland’s Webinar on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6JVsau4zw0">Access Technology for Audio Description &amp; Captioning: Supporting an Accessible Arts Programme</a>.</p>
<h3 id="perfume-%2F-chemical-sensitivity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#perfume-%2F-chemical-sensitivity">§</a> Perfume / Chemical Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Those with chemical sensitivities are highly sensitive to petroleum based products and fragrances found in cleaning products, perfumes, detergents and building products. These chemicals or smells can induce migraines, asthma, cognitive impairments and allergic reactions, and harm many people with chronic illness.</p>
<p>Organisations can request audiences to attend an event or venue fragrance free. Organisations can also refrain from using scented products and clean regularly with non-toxic products. Smoking areas should be positioned well away from doors and windows.</p>
<h3 id="quiet-%2F-sensory-rooms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quiet-%2F-sensory-rooms">§</a> Quiet / Sensory Rooms</h3>
<p>A quiet room is a space where audiences and staff can visit when they are overstimulated or need to rest, which facilitates access for many people including those with mobility barriers, chronic illness/pain or who are neurodivergent. These spaces should be quiet, painted with neutral colours, with dim lighting and include furniture suitable to sit or nap on. They can also include soft furnishing including cushions, blankets and weighted blankets. Eating, drinking and speaking should be discouraged in the space.</p>
<p>Quiet rooms can be permanent spaces in an institution or temporary when using an external venue. Venues often have limited space so if necessary quiet rooms can be used as multi-denominational prayer rooms or meditation rooms to support the needs of wider communities.</p>
<h3 id="seating" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#seating">§</a> Seating</h3>
<p>Providing adequate and comfortable seating for a wide set of needs is essential for an accessible experience. People have varying needs, and a selection of seating should be provided to meet those needs. Instead of benches and stools, benches with backs and chairs with armrests can better facilitate access. Avoid low seating as that can be inaccessible for many. When arranging seating ensure there is adequate space of 1.5m for a wheelchair to pass by and ensure surrounding spaces are clear of equipment and barriers.</p>
<h3 id="sign-language-interpretation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sign-language-interpretation">§</a> Sign Language Interpretation</h3>
<p>The use of Irish Sign Language (ISL) and British Sign Language (BSL) at public events can facilitate access for d/Deaf and hard of hearing communities. Not all d/Deaf and hard of hearing people in Ireland and the UK use ISL or BSL, so the needs of the community should be considered when booking sign language interpretation services. Captioning may be a more accessible service for a broader set of audiences, including d/Deaf and hard of hearing people. ISL or BSL interpretation might not be needed at all events but regular ISL or BSL events should be programmed to serve the community. Audiences should also have the option to request ISL or BSL interpretation for an event, with an interpreter booked on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>BSL interpreters can be hired via services such as <a href="https://interpretersofcolour.net/">Interpreters of Colour Network</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>You can find information on where to hire an ISL interpreter on the <a href="https://www.irishdeafsociety.ie/interpreters/booking-an-interpreter/">Irish Deaf Society</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sliding-scale-prices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sliding-scale-prices">§</a> Sliding Scale Prices</h3>
<p>Many people face economic barriers when accessing arts and culture and artworkers can facilitate this access by providing sliding scale prices. Prices should be lower for Low-Income, Disabled, Students, Pensioners, Carers or Children, or whichever groups are facing economic barriers in a specific community. You can also include options to donate or pay forward for those who can afford to support the costs of reducing economic barriers for others.</p>
<h3 id="support-workers-and-service-animals" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-workers-and-service-animals">§</a> Support Workers and Service Animals</h3>
<p>Some people are accompanied by a support worker or a personal assistant. A support worker is someone that assists disabled people to reduce access barriers in everyday life, education, work, culture or care. A support worker should be supported in their visit and provided with free tickets to ticketed events.</p>
<p>Service animals are trained animals that support a wide range of disabled people. Service animals should be welcomed into venues and accommodated. If another audience member has animal allergies, a member of staff should mediate the situation where both audience members can use different parts of the venue.</p>
<h3 id="mobility" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mobility">§</a> Mobility</h3>
<p>For new builds or those renovating their sites, venues should follow current legal building standards, which you can find on the<a href="https://www.iwa.ie/access-guidelines/great-outdoors-access-guidelines/7-access-to-the-built-environment/">Irish Wheelchair Association built environment standards</a>.</p>
<p>For buildings that are architecturally inaccessible, there are a number of provisions that can be made to reduce mobility barriers, short of full renovations. This can include installing ramps, handrails and providing mobility devices. Also ensure that there is 1.5m space between objects for a wheelchair to navigate, especially in exhibitions. Staff can also provide assistance when requested and given consent to do so.</p>
<p>If a venue is architecturally inaccessible, it is vital that this information is included in an access statement so audiences can make an informed decision about their visit and the access barriers they face.</p>
<h3 id="printed-matter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#printed-matter">§</a> Printed Matter</h3>
<p>When designing publications, brochures or other printed matter, it is important to consider the access needs of readers. Fonts should be between 16 - 18 points, sans serif, well spaced, and high contrast colours. In addition to using high contrast colours, when designing opportunities it’s also essential to consider the needs of colour blind people. You can check what colours are colour blind friendly on <a href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40">Colouring for Colorblindness</a>.</p>
<p>The average reading age of someone in the UK is 9 years old so it is valuable to consider what language is accessible to most people when writing texts.</p>
<h3 id="touch-tours" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#touch-tours">§</a> Touch Tours</h3>
<p>Touch tours facilitate access for blind and low vision people. If an exhibition includes physical objects, opportunities to touch the work, with the consent of the artists, reduces barriers to the enjoyment and participation of art. You can also use props, replicas or relief versions of 2D artworks if artworks are unable to be touched. Touch tours are most effective as part of audio description tours, alongside braille or audio guides.</p>
<h3 id="transcriptions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#transcriptions">§</a> Transcriptions</h3>
<p>Transcripts can reduce access barriers for d/Deaf and hard of hearing people to sound. When showing sound works, captioned versions or a transcript of the audio should be shared through printed matter or via a QR code. When QR codes are offered, organisations should make sure that there is sufficient signal available and/or wifi available to access the content of the QR code.</p>
